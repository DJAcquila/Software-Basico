man as

GNU as is really a family of assemblers.  If you use (or have used) the GNU assembler on one architecture, you should find a fairly similar
environment when you use it on another architecture.  Each version has much in common with the others, including object file formats, most
assembler directives (often called pseudo-ops) and assembler syntax.
as is primarily intended to assemble the output of the GNU C compiler "gcc" for use by the linker "ld".  Nevertheless, we've tried to make
as assemble correctly everything that other assemblers for the same machine would assemble.  Any exceptions are documented explicitly.
This doesn't mean as always uses the same syntax as another assembler for the same architecture; for example, we know of several
incompatible versions of 680x0 assembly language syntax.

man ld

 ld combines a number of object and archive files, relocates their data and ties up symbol references. Usually the last step in compiling a
 program is to run ld.
